Hi! Let's edit our AHHASC system for our Java assignment here!

Do take note of the following details while doing the assignment:
- Remember to work on your own class!
- For images, do manually resize it before attaching it into the system.
  - The reason behind this is that using Java to resize the picture will make the picture look pixelated.

That's all for now, and have fun with coding!
